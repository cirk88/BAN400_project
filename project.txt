Project suggestion Group 30

Initial proposal: 

"Textual data analysis combined with regression analysis using data on fake/true news

Analysis:

 - Sentiment analysis to gather data on how negative /positive the fake news is compared with true news.
 - Doing a word count for specific words.
 - Run a regression, were 1 is fake news and 0 is true news
 - Maybe a time series analysis.

For this we will use a data set from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/clmentbisaillon/fake-and-real-news-dataset 
(Links to an external site.) with data from 2016 to 2017.

All graphs will be visualized using ggplot package.

 - Use machine learning
 - Apply it to live data

Workflow: 

1. get the data to run in R and tidyverse
  
  -1.1.1 merge true and fake news datasets, adding a new dummy column if news is true or fake. 

  -1.1 sepparate the data into training and test data. 

  -1.2 make sure that the data is randomly sampled and that the recipe will work nicely on the test aswell as it will on the training data. 

2. Getting the data ready for modelling. 

  -2.1 cleaning the words, and making them ready for the sensitivy analysis(making a frequency list)
  
    -2.1.1 Use recipes in order to make this cleaning process             replicable for test data 


  -2.2 Using the sensitivity analysis to make usable columns in a tibble for each news article. 

  -2.3 gathering all the data into one tibble, which we'll use to train our machine learning model. 

3. Training the machine learning model

4. Test the model, and polish it (maybe go back to step 2 if need be)

5. make a shiny app, which will work as an interface to plug in new data and see if the news stories is true or fake. 

  5.1 make the app more user friendly
