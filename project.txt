Project suggestion Group 30

Textual data analysis combined with regression analysis using data on fake/true news

Analysis:

 - Sentiment analysis to gather data on how negative /positive the fake news is compared with true news.
 - Doing a word count for specific words.
 - Run a regression, were 1 is fake news and 0 is true news
 - Maybe a time series analysis.

For this we will use a data set from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/clmentbisaillon/fake-and-real-news-dataset 
(Links to an external site.) with data from 2016 to 2017.

All graphs will be visualized using ggplot package.

 - Use machine learning
 - Apply it to live data
